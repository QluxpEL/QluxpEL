### 🔸 **Mailbox Misery**

**200+ visits — Classic Roblox horror experience**  
**Role:** Main scripting developer on an older account  
<br>

<p align="left">
Mailbox Misery is a horror game where players take on the role of a mail delivery person. They must deliver mail around the city, collecting currency along the way, which can be used to purchase items for the upcoming night. During the night, a monster attempts to invade the house. Players can light up rooms to prevent the monster from entering specific areas, but doing so drains power. Additionally, the game features a music tape that, when activated, accelerates the in-game time, although it significantly increases the passage of time.
