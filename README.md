<h2 align="left">🧠 What I Do</h2>

<p align="left">
With over three years of experience on Roblox, I’ve developed a deep understanding of the platform and its capabilities.  
I focus on creating code that not only works well but is easy to maintain, scalable, and optimized to run smoothly for all players.
</p>

<p align="left">
I frequently work with:
</p>
<br>

• DataStore – saving player progress safely and efficiently  
• TweenService & animation of UI/UX – making interfaces feel alive  
• Raycasting – detecting interactions and building physics-based systems  
• Object Oriented Programming – keeping my code organized and reusable  
• In-game performance optimization – making games run fast on all devices  
• Networking / server–client communication – syncing gameplay smoothly for multiplayer  

---

<h2 align="left">💻 Languages & Tools</h2>

<p align="left">
I primarily work with Roblox LuaU, the scripting language of Roblox, which allows me to build both simple and complex game mechanics.   
</p>

• Roblox LuaU – scripting game mechanics, systems, and AI behavior  
• Roblox Studio – building, testing, and polishing gameplay experiences  
• Roblox TopBar+ – a community resource for dispalying topbar icons  
• Roblox Cmdr – a community resource allowing to create administrative commands

### 🔸 **Mailbox Misery**

**200+ visits — Classic Roblox horror experience**  
**Role:** Main scripting developer on an older account  
<br>

<p align="left">
Mailbox Misery is a horror game where players take on the role of a mail delivery person. They must deliver mail around the city, collecting currency along the way, which can be used to purchase items for the upcoming night. During the night, a monster attempts to invade the house. Players can light up rooms to prevent the monster from entering specific areas, but doing so drains power. Additionally, the game features a music tape that, when activated, accelerates the in-game time, although it significantly increases the passage of time.
